# üöÄ The Clinical AI Prodigy: From NICU to Machine Learning Research

## Who Does This? A Neonatologist Building State-of-the-Art ML Models

Most doctors barely use Excel. Most ML engineers never touched a patient.  
**I'm the rare intersection:** 12+ years NICU experience + research-grade ML expertise.
